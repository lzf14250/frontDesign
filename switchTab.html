                        The United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) announced in a statement,
                         “The Postal Service is shocked and saddened by the events that occurred yesterday in the Midland-Odessa area.
                           We are especially grieving the loss of our postal family member, letter carrier Mary Granados, age 29,
                            and we continue to keep her family in our thoughts.”

                        The mail carrier “was carjacked and murdered while working,” according 
                        to a GoFundMe page created to help Granados’ family with funeral expenses.

                        “I had the privilege to work with Mary in the past,” Leslie Aide, who created the page with
                         the permission of Granados’ twin sister, wrote. “She was beautiful inside and out, 
                         with a great heart and always ready to be a friend, always had a smile on her face!”

                        Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke suggested Sunday that more people could 
                        have died had police not killed the gunman outside a crowded movie theater. 
                        Two of the victims died overnight.
